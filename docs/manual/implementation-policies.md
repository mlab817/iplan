# 3 Implementation Policies

[[toc]]

The Department of Agriculture’s planning and budgeting processes operates on the general
principle that ***planning shall be participatory, dynamic and iterative.***

Specifically, the following shall be the guiding principles in the design and implementation of
the I-PLAN component.

a. **The AFMP as basis for prioritizing public agriculture and fishery investments.** The
AFMP is the translation of the goals, agenda and policies espoused in the Philippine
Development Plan (PDP), Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), and
other policy and program issuances into strategic programs and projects to be
implemented over the medium term. As such, it should be the continuing basis and
consistent context for the DA’s investment programming, annual plan and budget
proposals and actual fund allocation across operating units and functions.

b. **DA-LGU partnership in the formulation of the plan to ensure smooth
implementation of agriculture and fishery (AF) projects.** Full partnership with LGUs
is attained through constant dialogues and collaborative activities. MRDP has
significantly succeeded mainly because of this process. For its part, the DA needs to
recognize that planning is done at all levels. It is the role of the DA that its plans (e.g.
AFMP) reflect what it is able to synchronize from the ground with macroeconomic
goals. This partnership process can be significantly improved and will be a focus
point under PRDP.  

In addition, the PRDP through the I-PLAN will combine “top-to-bottom” and
“bottom-up” approaches to planning and programming. This two-pronged approach
will help ensure that the Department’s budgetary resources will be prudently
allocated to priority programs, projects and activities that are supportive of the PDP
2011-2016 goals and strategies for the agriculture and fisheries sector.

c. **Use of science-based tools for resilient and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sector.** The need to make the sector sustainable and resilient has been a long-
standing concern in the face of expanding land and water degradation and the realities of climate change (CC). The AFMP framework and guidelines call for the
identification of innovative measures to respond to climate change and mainstream
climate change adaptation and risk reduction in the various DA interventions. The
PRDP will move towards using improved tools for assessing CC vulnerability. One
refinement will be the use of the vulnerability and suitability assessment in the
planning process.

d. **Value chain development context for subproject design.** A value chain refers to the
full range of activities which are required to bring a product or service through the different phases of production, including physical transformation, the inputs of
various producer services, and response to consumer demand. When carefully
implemented, it will determine the “value” that is created in a product or service
resulting from a determined set of value-adding processes and the participation of
actors of the sector (i.e., farmers/fishers, private sector).

The framework and guidelines for the preparation of the AFMP 2011-2017
specifically espoused the identification of projects using a value chain framework
that aims to equalize income opportunities for men and women and promote more
efficient linkages among producers, processors, marketing channels, and consumers. The tool for assessing value chains was simplified in the AFMP preparation. The I-
PLAN’s use of the full process in the conduct of value chain approach, including complementary market analysis at the local, national and international levels, will
deepen the analysis to come up with the interventions to be supported in I-BUILD
and I‐REAP.

e. **Geo-tagging**, an information and communications technology (ICT) tool will be used
to enhance appreciation of information on commodities especially in the
establishment of the situation obtaining in a commodity chain during value chain
mapping. It saves time and resources by enabling analysts and stakeholders to
visualize the field situation without actually going to the locality. Hence, it is a useful
tool not only in plan formulation but also in the monitoring and evaluation of plans.  

Geo-tagging is the process of attaching location-specific information to various
media types, such as pictures of project sites before, during and after project
implementation, using a GPS-enabled android phone with Google as the platform. 

f. **Integrated service delivery through synergistic partnership.** The PRDP will enhance
delivery of critical services by instituting a mechanism to get the appropriate
technical service providers, including the DA operating units, other government
agencies (GAs), academe, civil society organizations (CSOs), and other value chain
participants (e.g. processors, exporters) involved in a synergistic manner. This will
involve scoping of existing modalities for providing AF technical support services,
benchmarking vis‐à-vis best practices and taking part or all of the steps within these
modalities, as deemed appropriate, to institutionalize an integrated AF service
delivery. Tailor fitting of technical services to commodity requirements as well as
standardization are expected under PRDP. As such, service units can no longer afford
to be standalone units with unclear connection of their contribution to particular
commodity value chains. 

g. **Natural resource management** in globally significant biodiversity areas, seascapes
and landscapes, and priority degraded coastal areas. This will be given attention
through the Global Environment Facility (GEF)‐funded PRA‐RSA activities. PRA-RSA will be used as a tool for the NRM interventions geared towards rebuilding marine
fisheries, coastal pollution reduction, management of trans‐boundary water
systems, and effective management of local marine areas; and management of
globally biodiversity significant protected area systems, landscapes / seascapes and
sectors.  
The PRA-RSA shall include the following GEF interventions: 1) habitats and species
assessment; 2) change assessment; 3) marine protected areas; and 4) socio-cultural
and geopolitical profile.
