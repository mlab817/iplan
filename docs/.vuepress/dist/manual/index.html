Levels (I-Plan) Component of the Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) of the
Department of Agriculture (DA) will provide the users with a step by step guide on the
implementation of the I-PLAN activities, from the prioritization of national and regional
commodities, to the conduct of the value chain analyses for the selected priority
commodities, up to the preparation of the Provincial Commodity/ies Investment Plans. The
manual defines the processes, procedures and guidelines for enabling the national and
regional AFMPs to be the main basis for the DA’s priority setting, resource allocation and
support service delivery. This entails institutionalizing the Department-wide use of the
AFMP as the strategic and operational road map for national and regional agriculture and
agribusiness development. Further, results of the OM processes will be an input in making
adjustments in the regional and national AFMPs.
The users of the manual are all the stakeholders concerned in preparing the national,
regional and provincial plans for the implementation of the PRDP. These include the
concerned units of the DA particularly its Regional Field Units (RFUs), provincial local
government units (LGUs), the farmer leaders, local organizations and private sector
representatives.
The OM will be the official reference of the proponents, implementers, decision-makers,
beneficiaries, partner organizations and other stakeholders in the implementation of the
PRDP I-PLAN component.</p> <h2 id="_1-2-scope-and-limitations"><a href="#_1-2-scope-and-limitations" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.2 Scope and Limitations</h2> <p>The Manual does not attempt to provide courses of action for every decision point. Rather,
it lays down the procedures for the implementation of the I-PLAN Component under the
PRDP relating to the conduct of the prioritization of commodities and value chain analyses
for the selected priority commodities at the national and regional levels, enhancing the
NAFMP and RAFMP, and preparation of the Provincial Commodity/ies Investment Plans.
It also provides processes for the harmonization of plans within DA, with PLGUs and with
national agencies that are concerned in the provision of services for the implementation of
the AFMP.</p> <h2 id="_1-3-i-plan-component-general-description"><a href="#_1-3-i-plan-component-general-description" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.3 I-PLAN Component: General Description</h2> <p>The I-PLAN component aims to strengthen the DA’s planning and budget execution
processes through the institutionalization of the AFMP as the basis for resource allocation
and prioritization of DA programs, projects, and activities implemented at the national and
regional levels.</p> <p>Further and equally important is giving emphasis to monitoring and evaluation at various
levels and purposes. Both operations and results monitoring and evaluation need to be
improved and assigned to the appropriate offices.
Resource allocation will include, among others, developing institutional arrangements and
mechanisms to facilitate co-financing with participating LGUs and funds flow to programs,
with the end in view of transferring authority and accountability for AFMP implementation
and budget execution from the DA Central Office to the RFUs since recent DBM reforms
have enabled the downloading of budgets directly to the RFUs.
Cognizant of the importance of optimizing the use of scarce resources, prioritization of
commodities and programs has to be done. I-PLAN will provide tools for prioritization of
both commodities to be supported and the critical public programs and services and
investments needed to effectively support the development of these commodity value
chains. I-PLAN will also ensure the integration of the small farmers and fishers in these
priority value chains.
Strengthening the budgeting and planning processes would involve the following strategic
thrusts:1</p> <p>a. Convergence on integrated ridge-to-reef planning involving multiple agencies;<br>
b. Planning techniques incorporating disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation
and participatory resource assessments; and<br>
c. Development of value chain maps including LGU clusters to provide economies of
scale for particular commodities that would provide inputs to the selection and
prioritization of investments to be supported under the PRDP.</p> <p>I-PLAN support will be by way of appropriate combinations of technical assistance, capacity
building, and science-based planning tools for mainstreaming the DA’s AFMP Planning
Framework. It will build on the gains and in-roads made from bottom-up planning through
other foreign-assisted projects or initiatives, specifically the Mindanao Rural Development
Program or MRDP, and learning from the implementation of the Diversified Farm Income
and Market Development Project (DFIMDP).</p> <h2 id="_1-4-background-and-key-institutional-issues"><a href="#_1-4-background-and-key-institutional-issues" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.4 Background and Key Institutional Issues</h2> <p>If the goals set in the Agri-Pinoy 2011, PDP 2011-2016, and AFMP 2011-2017 of inclusive
growth and reduced poverty, food security and increased incomes, increased resilience to
climate change risks, global competitiveness and sustainability are to be achieved, there is a
need for a re-orientation of all planners, especially in the agriculture and fishery sector.
The following issues have been observed in the current planning and budgeting processes:</p> <p>a. <strong>Focus on production systems</strong>. Programs and resources are currently focused on the production systems of commodities. This situation fails to optimize the use of finite
resources because all commodities in a given region are equally given emphasis and
allocated resources.</p> <p>b. <strong>Lack of harmonization and coordination of plans and programs</strong>. There is apparent
lack of harmonization and integration of plans and programs generated by the
Central Office and those produced at the local levels. This harmonization is supposed
to be most visible at the level of the DA-RFUs. However, it is observed that regional
DA operations continue to be strongly managed at the DA Central Office.</p> <p>It has further been observed that certain agencies of the DA generate plans on their
own without coordinating with the DA Planning Service and with minimal or no local
stakeholder participation. This emphasizes the role of the Planning Service to
provide macroeconomic frameworks and benchmarks for planning for all DA units.</p> <p>c. <strong>Not all that is planned is actually funded and implemented</strong>. This issue points to the
need to prioritize commodities and value chain components to be supported with
public programs and services, given very scarce resources.</p> <p>d. <strong>Global climate change</strong>. The current global climate change has altered the traditional
rainfall patterns, among others, that render confusion in the planting calendar of the
farmers and the fishing schedule of the fisherfolk. It has also wreaked havoc on their
means of livelihood. These circumstances point to the need for disaster and risk
mitigation factors that need to be established to minimize losses in production
volume and deterioration of the quality of agricultural produce. Research and
development efforts could be focused on adaptation measures such as developing
seeds and planting materials, as well as animal genetic materials engineered while
current infrastructure protocols should be improved to be more resilient to a
changing climate.</p> <p>e. <strong>Lack of coordination between research functions and activities as inputs to plan
formulation</strong>. A review undertaken under MRDP1 of on-going research activities at
the national and regional levels revealed overlapping of functions of the various
concerned agencies. Moreover, research activities at the regional level are similarly
not well coordinated; the organizational arrangements are inefficient and confusing;
and they are not as responsive as they should be to the real needs of the LGUs and
communities.</p> <p>The I-PLAN Component of the PRDP aims to address these issues through the refinement of
the AFMP Planning Framework and Guidelines that would serve as basis for plan iteration.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/mlab817/iplan-om/edit/master/docs/manual/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page on GitHub</a> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">6/24/2020, 12:56:24 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><!----> <span class="next"><a href="/manual/the-iplan-component.html">
