complementary tracks, namely, the enhancement of the AFMPs (national and regional)and
the preparation of the Provincial Commodity(ies) Investment Plans.</p> <p>The leadership in planning for agricultural development is lodged with the Department of
Agriculture with pre-determined objectives tied to national targets. Moreover, local
governments, by their very nature are less aware of national economic growth potentials.
Thus, it is the mandate of DA, being at the top of the government set up, and having a wider
perspective, to provide guidance in planning the investments from public sector and invites
much larger stakeholder consultation, particularly with the private sector, in selecting and
planning for the development of priority commodity value chains.</p> <p>The planning approach to be espoused shall be anchored on the use of the value chain
approach (VCA) for more objective identification of interventions for the development or
enhancement of priority commodities. A value chain is defined as the <em>full range of activities
which are required to bring a product or service from conception, through the different
phases of production (involving a combination of physical transformation and the input of
various producer services), delivery to final customers, and final disposal after use.</em> It
involves an analysis of the vertical and horizontal process and players that add value to the
product. A detailed discussion on the conduct of the VCA is included in Annex 1.</p> <h3 id="_4-1-1-enhancing-the-national-afmp"><a href="#_4-1-1-enhancing-the-national-afmp" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1 Enhancing the National AFMP</h3> <h4 id="_4-1-1-1-formation-of-the-national-core-planning-team-ncpt"><a href="#_4-1-1-1-formation-of-the-national-core-planning-team-ncpt" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1.1 Formation of the National Core Planning Team (NCPT).</h4> <p>The planning process shall
be facilitated by the NPCO thru the DA Planning Service. A National Core Planning Team
(NCPT) shall be formed to undertake the whole planning process of a priority commodity at
the national level. This may be composed of:</p> <ul><li>DA Planning Service representative</li> <li>BSWM representative</li> <li>I-BUILD Component Representative/Field Operations Service</li> <li>I-REAP Component Representative/ DA AMAS</li> <li>BFAR Representative</li> <li>Commodity Program/Agency representative concerned</li> <li>BAS representative</li> <li>VCA Expert</li> <li>ITCAF</li> <li>NAFC- assist in the stakeholders consultation; and the involvement of NAFC’s
Sectoral Committees by Commodity as a player in the VCA of a particular commodity</li></ul> <p>The team shall be augmented with members coming from other bureaus, attached agencies and corporations concerned with the subject commodity. It shall also include heads of RFU-
PMD, AMAD, PLGU-PPDC, and representatives from regional AFCs of the highest producing regions and provinces of the subject commodities. These representatives will ensure the
capture of provincial and regional nuances in the conduct of VCA for national priority
commodities. Representatives from DAR, DENR, DTI, DOST and DOE, among others, shall
also be invited as members of the NCPT, as needed.To ensure that the interests, needs and
concerns of the indigenous cultural communities or indigenous peoples (ICC/IPs) are taken
into consideration in the enhancement of the AFMP, the National Commission on
Indigeneous Peoples (NCIP) shall also be included in the NCPT (as necessary).</p> <p>The involvement of the National Core Planning Team from the DA units shall be sanctioned
through a Special Order (SO) from the DA Secretary. The involvement of DAR, DENR and
DILG personnel shall be ensured through the National Convergence Initiative among these
agencies and DA. Other team members from DOST, DOE, DTI, SUCs, LGUs and private sector
shall be invited by the DA Secretary.</p> <h4 id="_4-1-1-2-training-of-ncpt"><a href="#_4-1-1-2-training-of-ncpt" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1.2 Training of NCPT.</h4> <p>The DA PS shall conduct 5-day intensive training for the NCPT on
the value chain approach (VCA) and other science-based tools to be used in the planning
process. This will be led by the VCA expert, complemented by resource persons for the
other tools, to be hired by the DA under the PRDP.</p> <p>To optimize use of resources, the participants will also include the regional core planning
teams (RCPT) that will lead the regional planning process. A separate training on the VCA
and other tools shall also be conducted for the planning staff of bureaus, attached agencies
and corporations and banner programs to ensure proper and correct use of these tools in
the preparation of their agencies’ plans and programs. A general orientation on the VCA will
also be provided to DA MANCOM.</p> <h4 id="_4-1-1-3-prioritization-of-commodities-at-national-level"><a href="#_4-1-1-3-prioritization-of-commodities-at-national-level" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1.3 Prioritization of Commodities at National Level.</h4> <p>After the capacity training, the NCPT shall start the planning process with the prioritization of commodities to be subjected with value chain analysis. The process flow in the prioritization of the commodities at the national level is shown in Appendix 1A. The following steps shall be followed:</p> <p><strong>Step 1: Review of Existing AFMP and Preparation of List of Commodities for
Prioritization.</strong> The NCPT shall review the existing AFMP and identify commodities for
prioritization. Commodities that have been pre-determined by the national government as
priority commodities because of their importance in the attainment of national goal of food
sufficiency such as rice and corn, both of which are supported with a national program, shall
be given priority. Other commodities of national importance, such as coconut (which affects
a third of the country’s population, most of whom belong to the bottom of the pyramid)
and sugarcane shall also be included as priority commodities. All other commodities with
national scope, especially those that are supported by the High Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP), fisheries and livestock shall be included in the list of commodities that
will go through a prioritization process.</p> <p><strong>Step 2. Concurrence of NPCO on Commodity List.</strong> The NCPT shall present to the NPCO two
listsof commodities: a list of commodities that are considered national priorities and will not
have to go through the prioritization process, and another list of commodities that shall go
through the prioritization process. The NPCO shall approve these lists before the NCPT shall
proceed with the prioritization process.</p> <p><strong>Step 3. Gathering and Analysis of Data for Commodity Prioritization.</strong> The NCPT shall
conduct the following data gathering and analysis tools:</p> <ul><li>Review existing literature, like BAS reports, industry studies, sectoral reports, Local
Development Plans, Local Development Investment Plans, etc.</li> <li>Suitability Assessment. This tool will take off from the Vulnerability and Suitability
(VSA) developed by the DA’s BSWM12 and shall be used as a guide to determine the
suitability of a particular area that could affect the production and suitability of a
particular commodity. It also shows the areas where particular commodities can be
best grown or raised.</li> <li>Rapid Market Appraisal (RMA). RMA is an iterative and interactive research
methodology, which is used to better understand complex market systems in a short
time. (Adapted from Young 1994). It is a methodology that facilitates the
identification of proper interventions or support programs to improve efficiency or
strengthen the marketing system in a way that would bring the broadest benefits to
the most number of participants in the system. The focus of the RMA shall be on
market size, market growth potential, ease of entry and potential for value addition.
Although the conduct of the RMA is described in Annex 4, secondary data on the
market may suffice when using the prioritization tool. A deeper analysis of the
market may be done during the conduct of the VCA.</li></ul> <p>The use of these science-based tools shall include thorough consultation and participation
of stakeholders. This is necessary because with limited resources and a multiplicity of
stakeholders and their needs, legitimate competition for assets and resources is inevitable.
But it can be resolved if an effective strategy of stakeholder consultations and negotiations
is thoroughly planned. It is especially important to ensure participation of women in general
and those from the disadvantaged sections in particular. In the agriculture sector, the
absence of adequate participation of women, the view of many important issues may
remain highly biased in favor of the male population. The participation of women can lead to a more balanced view of agricultural development. It is, therefore, necessary that the
planning team regularly invites stakeholder representatives in the conduct of the various
analysis tools for prioritization and in finalizing the plans.</p> <p>The members of the NCPT shall be assigned in sub-groups for data gathering according to
their expertise following criteria used in the CPT (Table 4-1):</p> <p><strong>Table 4-1. Criteria for Prioritizing Commodities</strong></p> <table><thead><tr><th>Criteria</th> <th>Sub –criteria</th> <th>Data Source &amp; NCPT Member Responsible</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Suitability</td> <td></td> <td>BSWM. This criterion shall be accomplished by the team composed of the staff of BSWM using the suitability aspect of the VSA tool. The BSWM representative in the NCPT shall be responsible to assemble the data for this criterion.</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan="4">Market Potential</td> <td>Market size</td> <td rowspan="4">RMA /FGD. The data will be collected through focused group dialogue (FGD – Annex 3) with industry market players and growers, and will be limited to the needs of the prioritization tool. For this criteria group, the team shall be led by the DA-AMAS. The FGD participants shall also include marketing officers of the bureaus, attached agencies and corporations, program directorates and other national agencies (such as DAR, DENR, DTI), SUC experts, and private sector representatives.</td></tr> <tr><td>Market growth potential</td></tr> <tr><td>Ease of entry</td></tr> <tr><td>Potential for value addition</td></tr> <tr><td rowspan="2">Impact on the Poor</td> <td>Number of poor people involved</td> <td rowspan="2">BAS. For this criterion, the team shall be composed of PS and BAS staff to gather and analyze data. Secondary data sources will also be useful to determine impact based on the management, technical and financial aspects of the commodity.</td></tr> <tr><td>Potential to raise / create income</td></tr> <tr><td>Number of Growers/Producers</td> <td></td> <td>BAS. For this criterion, the team shall be composed of PS and BAS staff to gather and analyze data from BAS.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p><strong>Step 4. Actual Commodity Prioritization.</strong> The Commodity Prioritization Tool (CPT) in
Annexes 2, 2A or 2B shall be used in preparing the priority commodity list. After all the
necessary data are gathered by each sub-group, the NCPT shall conduct a one-day workshop
session to analyze and consolidate all data, accomplish the CPT and rank each commodity
based on the result of the CPT to come up with the draft commodity priority list to be
recommended for national VCA.</p> <p><strong>Step 5: Approval of prioritization commodities.</strong> The NCPT through the NPCO shall present
the list of priority commodities to the DA-ExeCom and get its approval for national value
chain analysis. The DA ExeCom may recommend an additional analysis to be done by the
NCPT should it find the list inadequate. Otherwise, the final list of commodities for VCA shall
be confirmed by the DA ExeCom.</p> <h4 id="_4-1-1-4-conduct-of-value-chain-analysis"><a href="#_4-1-1-4-conduct-of-value-chain-analysis" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1.4. Conduct of Value Chain Analysis.</h4> <p>The NCPT shall conduct the VCA for each of the
approved priority commodities using the value chain approach (Annex 1) except for
commodities with existing updated and adequate VCAs. The NCPT shall be divided into
smaller groups to handle the various commodities. The small groups that are assigned for
each commodity will be guided by the VCA expert hired by NPCO.</p> <p>The conduct of new VCAs and enhancement of existing VCAs will be guided by the processes
discussed in Annex 1 and Appendix 2A. The process flow involves the following steps:</p> <p><strong>Step 1. Validation of Existing VCA studies.</strong> From the approved priority commodity list, the
VCA expert shall conduct an inventory of existing VCA studies (on the concerned commodity
or product) in order to avoid duplication.</p> <p><strong>Step 2. Mapping the Value Chain.</strong> Value chain mapping involves the gathering of data to
establish the current industry condition or current situation in the selected commodity or
product. Complete and correct data on each of the segments and participants lead to
correct analysis.The conduct of the VCA at the data gathering stage shall require the
participation of commodity experts from the bureaus, attached agencies and corporations
(that are involved in specific commodities) and other national agencies (such as DAR, DENR,
DTI), SUC experts, top producing PLGUs, and private sector representatives through focus
group discussions at the regional and provincial levels where the commodities are
produced.</p> <p>The VCA Questionnaires (Annex 1A, 1C and 1D) for farmers, processors and
traders(respectively) have been prepared as guide for primary data collection. A
consolidation matrix (Annex 1E) is also included.</p> <p>For areas identified as GEF sites, Participatory Resource Assessment- Resources and Social
Assessment (PRA-RSA) will be conducted through a technical assistance. Annex 7 is a guide
on how the PRA-RSA may be conducted. PRA-RSA concerns with questions on resource
management to capture how the potential interventions in the segments of the value chain
affect the environment, especially in areas with GEF sites or where biodiversity or the
ecosystem may be disturbed or threatened. The responses to these questions will be used
to analyze problems and constraints so that proper natural resource management and
conservation measures shall be prescribed.</p> <p>Once the needed data are in, the commodity’s value chain map can be constructed/drawn.
The value chain map helps in determining the current situation of the commodity or the
current condition in the industry that will facilitate identification of opportunities,
constraints and issues in each of the segments of the chain.</p> <p><strong>Step 3. Analysis of the value chain.</strong> Value chain analysis involves both horizontal and
vertical analysis. One-at-a-time focus may be given on the following aspects, always mindful
of constraints, potential for upgrading and existing synergies: product flows - involving data
on the actors per segment or functions in the chain and determines the most important
actors within the value chain; process flow - involving data on technology, which includes
machines, manpower and production systems; costs involved - determining costs, prices and margins per actor in the chain, most value added to the value chain; and end markets -
in-depth market analysis to assess the value chain growth and competitiveness.</p> <p><strong>Step 4. Formulation of the Competitiveness Strategy and Identification of Interventions.</strong>
Formulating the competitiveness strategy for a commodity involves developing the
commodity’s value chain upgrading strategy. Upgrading refers to the innovation that
increases competitiveness in the value chain or moving towards sustained higher rates of
growth or expansion. Keeping in mind the principles involved in formulating
competitiveness strategies, the stage has been set for the identification of interventions and
programs that will strengthen the weak links in the chain.</p> <p>Should an intervention be indicated, in any segment of the VCA, the location best suited for
the intervention shall be determined through the VSA &amp; E-VSA tool (a E-VSA tool Guide is
available through PRDP website and a Manual is available at the PRDP I-SUPPORT –Geo
mapping and Governance Unit) . For this activity, the NCPT shall be trained to conduct of
the E-VSA.</p> <p><strong>Step 5. Writing the VCA report and Initial discussion of VC results with NPCO.</strong> The VCA
outputs shall be a comprehensive VCA report (Annex 1B) and a matrix of interventions along
the chain and shall be the basis for the concerned provinces that are identified in the value
chain in the preparation of their respective PCIPs (Annex 5). These VCA outputs shall also be
used in enhancing the NAFMP (Appendix 3A) and the RAFMP (Appendix 3B) of the regions
concerned in the value chain.</p> <p>However, it is recommended that prior to the stakeholders consultation, the initial VC
findings will be discussed with the NPCO-NCPT.</p> <p><strong>Step 6. Stakeholder consultation/validation.</strong> The NCPT will conduct stakeholder
validation/consultation on the output of the value chain analysis per commodity with the
representatives of concerned players in the VCA such as the businessmen, farmers’ groups,
and NGOs and also may include government agenciesand SUCs who are involved in the
commodity. ICC/IPs representatives shall be made critical participants in the consultation
process,whenever necessary.</p> <p>At this step of the process, it is recommended that a VCA expert/practitioner should
facilitate the stakeholders consultation/workshop. Annex 6.1 serves as guide in the conduct
of stakeholders workshop for the VCA.</p> <p><strong>Step 7. Submission of the Final VCA report.</strong> The Final VCA report shall incorporate the
inputs generated from the Stakeholders Consultation and shall be submitted to the NPCO.</p> <p><strong>Step. 8. Approval and Issuance of NOL.</strong> All final VCA reports must be submitted the NPCO
for issuance of No Objection Letter (NOL). If the result of the VCA report is not acceptable,
the process from Step 3 must be repeated. If the VCA report is acceptable, the NPCO will
issue a NOL. After which, a memorandum will be sent by the NPCO IPLAN to the DA RED re
the results of the VCA concerning his region and provinces. Upon receipt of the Memo, the concerned RED will communicate with the concerned PLGU re the start of the PCIP
formulation.</p> <p>As a quality check for the VCA report, the final document must have followed the prescribed
VCA report format in the I-PLAN OM (Annex 1B); must have done a stakeholders
consultation workshop (a report must be attached) and all pertinent annexes –
questionnaires (1A, 1B, 1C, 1E) and the list of VCA players must form part of the VCA report.</p> <h4 id="_4-1-1-5-enhancement-of-national-afmp"><a href="#_4-1-1-5-enhancement-of-national-afmp" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.1.5. Enhancement of National AFMP.</h4> <p>The DA-Planning Service shall enhance the
national AFMP based on the results of the value chain analysis. The results of the VCAs are
consolidated by the DA Planning Service and incorporated in the national AFMA, as an
addendum. This addendum will contain all changes in the AFMP as approved by the DA
Executive Committee. See Appendix 3A for the process flow of the AFMP enhancement.
The improvements in the commodity sector plans of the AFMP come in the form of
modifications and enhancements in validated commodities, implementation areas,
strategies and interventions.</p> <h3 id="_4-1-2-enhancing-the-regional-afmp"><a href="#_4-1-2-enhancing-the-regional-afmp" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.2 Enhancing the Regional AFMP</h3> <p>The I-PLAN activities at the regional level shall be done simultaneously with the national

Coordinating Office in the RFUs, to be led by the PMDand guided by a VCA expert. The steps
in the planning process are similar to those at the national level, with as follows:</p> <h4 id="_4-1-2-1-formation-of-a-regional-core-planning-team-rcpt"><a href="#_4-1-2-1-formation-of-a-regional-core-planning-team-rcpt" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.2.1 Formation of a Regional Core Planning Team (RCPT).</h4> <p>The composition of the planning team at the regional level is listed below, to be led by the RFU Planning and Monitoring Division.</p> <ul><li>RFU Planning and Monitoring Division</li> <li>BSWM-SWAC</li> <li>I-BUILD Component</li> <li>I-REAP Component / RFU- AMAD</li> <li>BFAR Regional Office</li> <li>Commodity coordinator concerned</li> <li>BAS representative</li> <li>VCA Expert</li> <li>RAFC – assist in the stakeholders consultation</li></ul> <p>This team shall be augmented with members coming from bureaus, attached agencies and

prioritization. Commodities that have been included in the national VCAs shall no longer be
included in the regional commodity list.</p> <p><strong>Step 2. Concurrence of RPCO on Commodity List.</strong> The RCPT shall present to the RPCO a
tentative list of commodities that shall go through the prioritization process. The RPCO shall
approve the list of commodities before the RCPT shall proceed with the prioritization
process.</p> <p><strong>Step 3. Gathering of Data for Commodity Prioritization.</strong> The process flow in the
prioritization of the commodities at the regional level is shown in Appendix 1B. The RCPT
shall start the data gathering by reviewing existing literature, like BAS reports, industry
studies, sectoral reports, Local Development Plans, Local Development Investment Plans,
etc. The tools such as Suitability Assessment and RMA shall be used to generate additional
data that are not contained in the existing literature. The members of the RCPT shall be
assigned in data gathering according to their expertise. Data to be gathered shall be those
on:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Criteria</th> <th>Data Source &amp; RCPT Member Responsible</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Suitability</td> <td>For this criterion, the appropriate portion of VSA tool of BSWM will be used. The suitability assessment shall be led by BSWM- Soil Water Access Coordinator.</td></tr> <tr><td>Market Potential</td> <td>For this criteria group, the team shall be led by the
AMAD. Using the RMA as guide, the data to be used for
this criterion will be generated thru FGD. The participants
shall include industry players from the private sector,
marketing officers of the regional bureaus, attached
agencies and corporations, program directorates and
other national agencies (such as DAR, DENR, DTI) and SUC
experts, for market data gathering using the RMA tools.</td></tr> <tr><td>Impact on the poor</td> <td>For this criterion, the team shall be composed of the
Planning and Monitoring Division of the RFU and BAS
regional staff to gather and analyze data from both BAS
and other secondary data, such as industry studies,
feasibility studies, commodity cultural practices,
technology requirements, labor requirements and income
potential.</td></tr> <tr><td>Number of Growers/Producers</td> <td>For this criterion, the team shall be composed of the
Planning and Monitoring Division of the RFU and BAS
regional staff to gather and analyze data from BAS.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p><strong>Step 4: Actual Prioritization of Commodities for Regional VCA.</strong> Like in the national priority
commodities, the CPT Annex 2 shall also be used to prioritize commodities approved by the
RPCO. The RCPT shall conduct a one-day workshop session to consolidate and analyze all
data, accomplish the CPT and actually rank each commodity based on the result of the CPT
to come up with the regional commodity priority list.</p> <p><strong>Emerging commodities and products</strong> that are not included in the list and does not have an
existing VCA but are being pushed by PLGUs because they are critical in provincial
development, as contained in their respective comprehensive development plans (CDP) and
Local Development Investment Plans (LDIP), shall be graded based on suitability and market
potential using a modified tool (Annex 2B). Emerging commodities with a total weighted
score of at least 5.0 shall be included in the list of priority commodities.</p> <p><strong>Step 5: Approval of Priority Commodities.</strong> The RCPT shall present the list of priority
commodities to the RPCO and get its approval on the top 5 commodities for regional value
chain analysis that will be funded by PRDP.</p> <p>The VCAs of commodities that do not land in the top 5 will use other sources of funds, if the
RPCO would still want to pursue it. The results of the VCA of these commodities may still be
considered in generating the PCIP of a particular province, as long as the VCA was prepared
following the PRDP process.</p> <h4 id="_4-1-2-4-conduct-of-regional-vca"><a href="#_4-1-2-4-conduct-of-regional-vca" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.1.2.4 Conduct of Regional VCA.</h4> <p>The RCPT shall conduct the VCA for each of the approved
priority commodities in the region using the value chain approach (Annex 1), except for
commodities with existing adequate VCAs. The Regional Core Planning Team will be joined by the PPDCs of the top producing provinces for the specific commodity for the conduct of
VCA. The RCPT will also be guided and supported by the VCA expert that will be hired by
PRDP through the NPCO or PSO.</p> <p>For commodities not in the priority list but with existing VCA reports, it maybe considered
and graded using the Annex 2A or 2B. The commodities with a total weighted score of at
least 5.0 shall be included in the list of priority commodities to be included in the PCIP.
However, the VCA of these commodities shall be reviewed for completeness and adequacy
by the NPCO. If the VCA for a commodity is found insufficient in substance, the VCA shall be
subject for enhancement by the RCPT and the province concerned.</p> <p>The conduct of new VCAs and enhancement of existing VCAs will be guided by the processes
discussed in Appendix 2B and in Annex 1 which is similar to the conduct of national VCAs as
described above.</p> <p><strong>Step 1. Validation of Existing VCA studies.</strong> From the approved priority commodity list, the
VCA expert shall conduct an inventory of existing VCA studies (on the concerned commodity
or product) in order to avoid duplication.</p> <p><strong>Step 2. Mapping the Value Chain.</strong> Value chain mapping involves the gathering of data to
establish the current industry condition or current situation in the selected commodity or
product. Complete and correct data on each of the segments and participants lead to
correct analysis. The conduct of the VCA at the data gathering stage shall require the
participation of commodity experts from the bureaus, attached agencies and corporations
(that are involved in specific commodities) and other national agencies (such as DAR, DENR,
DTI), SUC experts, top producing PLGUs, and private sector representatives through focus
group discussions at the regional and provincial levels where the commodities are
produced.</p> <p>The VCA Questionnaires (Annex 1A, 1C and 1D) for farmers, processors and
traders (respectively) have been prepared as guide for primary data collection. A
consolidation matrix (Annex 1E) is also included.</p> <p>For areas identified as GEF sites, Participatory Resource Assessment- Resources and Social
Assessment (PRA-RSA) will be conducted through a technical assistance. Annex 7 is a guide
on how the PRA-RSA may be conducted. PRA-RSA concerns with questions on resource
management to capture how the potential interventions in the segments of the value chain
affect the environment, especially in areas with GEF sites or where biodiversity or the
ecosystem may be disturbed or threatened. The responses to these questions will be used
to analyze problems and constraints so that proper natural resource management and
conservation measures shall be prescribed.</p> <p>Once the needed data are in, the commodity’s value chain map can be constructed/drawn.
The value chain map helps in determining the current situation of the commodity or the
current condition in the industry that will facilitate identification of opportunities,
constraints and issues in each of the segments of the chain.</p> <p><strong>Step 3. Analysis of the value chain. Value chain analysis involves both horizontal and
vertical analysis.</strong> One-at-a-time focus may be given on the following aspects, always mindful
of constraints, potential for upgrading and existing synergies: product flows -involving data
on the actors per segment or functions in the chain and determines the most important
actors within the value chain; process flow - involving data on technology, which includes
machines, manpower and production systems; costs involved - determining costs, prices
and margins per actor in the chain, most value added to the value chain; and end markets -
in-depth market analysis to assess the value chain growth and competitiveness.</p> <p><strong>Step 4. Formulating the Competitiveness Strategy and Identifying Interventions.</strong>
Formulating the competitiveness strategy for a commodity involves developing the
commodity’s value chain upgrading strategy. Upgrading refers to the innovation that
increases competitiveness in the value chain or moving towards sustained higher rates of
growth or expansion. Keeping in mind the principles involved in formulating
competitiveness strategies, the stage has been set for the identification of interventions and
programs that will strengthen the weak links in the chain.
Should an intervention be indicated, in any segment of the VCA, the location best suited for
the intervention shall be determined through the VSA &amp; E-VSA tool (a E-VSA tool Guide is
available through PRDP website and a Manual is available at the PRDP I-SUPPORT –Geo
mapping and Governance Unit). For this activity, the RCPT shall be trained to conduct of the
E-VSA.</p> <p><strong>Step 5. Writing the VCA report and Initial discussion of VC results with NPCO.</strong> The VCA
outputs shall be a comprehensive VCA report (Annex 1B)and a matrix of interventions along
the chain and shall be the basis for the concerned provinces that are identified in the value
chain in the preparation of their respective PCIPs (Annex 5). These VCA outputs shall also be
used in enhancing the RAFMP (Appendix 3B) of the regions concerned in the value chain.
However, it is recommended that prior to the stakeholders consultation, the initial VC
findings will be discussed with the RPCO-RCPT.</p> <p><strong>Step 6. Stakeholder consultation/validation.</strong> The RCPT will conduct a stakeholder
validation/consultation on the output of the value chain analysis per commodity with the
representatives of concerned players in the VCA such as the businessmen, farmers’ groups,
and NGOs and also may include government agenciesand SUCs who are involved in the
commodity. ICC/IPs representatives shall be made critical participants in the consultation
process,whenever necessary.
At this step of the process, it is recommended that a VCA expert/practitioner should
facilitate the stakeholders consultation/workshop. Annex 6.1 serves as guide in the conduct
of stakeholders workshop for the VCA.</p> <p><strong>Step 7. Submission of the Final VCA report.</strong> The Final VCA report shall incorporate the
inputs generated from the Stakeholders Consultation and shall be submitted by the RPCO to
the PSO and NPCO.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/mlab817/iplan-om/edit/master/docs/manual/implementation-processes.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page on GitHub</a> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">6/24/2020, 12:56:24 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
